This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
mtcars

names(mtcars)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}


cars<- read_csv("C:/Users/u0920521/Desktop/001.csv")

names(mtcars)

```
```{r}

cars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(meanmpg = mean(mpg))


```

```{r}
cars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=cyl, y=n)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
cars %>% 
  count(cyl) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=cyl, y=n)) +
  geom_col(fill="#741d5A") + 
  labs(y="Number", x="Cylinders") +
  ggtitle("Number of Cars by Cylinder") + 
  theme_minimal()


```
